LeRobot Rate Monotonic Phase 3 

Custom uart_3 serial is not working, so swithing to back to standard Serial 3 

Functionally: 

Frame ISR still schedules a servo read and then gets out.

UART ISR still fires when bits come back and pushes them into a buffer.

You just let Teensy’s HardwareSerial (Serial3) be the UART driver instead of your own uart3_driver.
